This is a copy of the git stable branch of Sean Baxter's 'mgpusort'
library (www.moderngpu.com). The initial commit provides extremely
fast radix sorting, plus a correctness/throughput test and a tool
for composing smaller radix sorts for optimal performance.

The major differences from the original MGPU codebase are as follows:

- removed the rest of the MGPU toolkit
- turned on all the bells and whistles in the test program
- removed code comparing mgpusort with other sorting packages
- added a few workarounds for non-Fermi GPUs. This doesn't 
  work yet (in particular the histogram kernels need to reduce
  their shared memory footprint to fit on non-Fermi cards)

Near future plans are as follows:

- modify the code to handle 64-bit keys; this is a necessity
  for GNFS polynomial selection
- modify the code for increased efficiency on simultaneous
  sorts of disparate arrays
